Quick Start Guide
===============

There are two main kb-python commands that cover most use cases: ``kb ref`` and ``kb count``, for building an index from a transcriptome reference and mapping/quantifying sequencing reads, respectively.

To run those commands, you can just type them into the command-line after install kb-python:

.. code-block:: shell

  kb ref ...
  kb count ...

Replace ... with whatever parameters you wish to supply to those commands.
