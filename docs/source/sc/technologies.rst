Technologies and the -x string
===============================

This section will cover how to tell the ``kb count`` within **kb-python** how to process sequencing data depending on the technology that produced the data. As different sequencing assays have different read structures, strandedness, parity, and barcodes, one must provide the specifications for the technology that produced the sequencing reads.


-x string
^^^^^^^^^

A **technology string** for a particular type of assay can be supplied via the ``-x`` option. The technology string can be specified in one of two ways:

* Several assays are predefined within the software (the list is viewable by calling ``kb --list``) so one can name one of those directly (e.g. one can specify ``-x 10xv3``).

* One can format their own **custom** technology string specifying the read locations of the barcodes, UMIs, and the biological sequence that is to be mapped (see below).


.. admonition:: Custom technology string

  The **custom** technology string (supplied to ``-x``) contains the format ``barcode:UMI:DNA``, representing the locational information of the barcode, UMI, and the DNA (where DNA is the biological read to be mapped):

  .. code-block:: text

    -x a,b,c:d,e,f:g,h,i

  * **a**: barcode file number, **b**: barcode start position, **c**: barcode end position
  * **d**: UMI file number, **e**: UMI start position, **f**: UMI end position
  * **g**: DNA file number, **h**: DNA start position, **i**: DNA end position

  .. important::
    File numbers and positions are zero-indexed. If no specific end position exists (i.e. the end position is the very end of the read), the end position should be set to **0**. If cell barcodes and/or UMIs are not supported by the technology, the barcode and/or UMI field can be set to ``-1,0,0``.

  An example for **10xv3** (10x Genomics, version 3 chemistry):

  .. code-block:: text

    -x 0,0,16:0,16,28:1,0,0

  Sequences can be stitched together by specifying multiple locations; for example, a SPLiT-seq assay, which contains three separate unlinked barcodes, each of length 8, and a UMI of length 10 in the second file and the DNA in the first file would look as follows:

  .. code-block:: text

    -x 1,10,18,1,48,56,1,78,86:1,0,10:0,0,0

  .. tip::
    For multiple locations: If the paired-end read mapping option is enabled, exactly two DNA locations should be specified (for the first and second read in the pair).

  If a technology does not fit into this format (e.g. due to barcodes or UMIs of variable lengths and positions), preprocessing of the FASTQ file should be performed beforehand to reformat the reads into a structure that can be handled by this format.

* Finally, ``seqspec`` can generate custom technology strings based on the assay specifications provided to it. Please see the section, :ref:`seqspec<seqspec intro>`, for details.

strandedness
^^^^^^^^^^^^

One uses the ``--strand`` option to specify how a read should be mapped in terms of strand orientation.

* ``--strand=forward``: If a read (or the first read in the case of paired-end reads) is to be mapped in forward orientation.
* ``--strand=reverse``: If a read (or the first read in the case of paired-end reads) is to be mapped in reverse orientation.
* ``--strand=unstranded``: If one does not want to map reads with strand-specificity.


If a predefined name is used in the technology string ``-x`` option (option 1), then kb-python uses a default stranded option for that technology (e.g. for 10xv3, the default is *forward*); otherwise, the default is *unstranded*. Setting the ``--strand`` option explicitly will overrule the default option.

  .. tip::
    If very few reads are being mapped, sometimes it's because the specified ``--strand`` setting is incorrect (or the default stranded option for the technology isn't incorrect and needs to be overwritten explicitly by setting the correct ``--strand`` option). 

parity
^^^^^^

Using the ``--parity`` option:

If the technology involves two biological read files that are derived from paired-end sequencing (as is the case with Smartseq2 and Smartseq3 and many bulk RNA sequencing kits), one should specify ``--parity=paired`` to perform mapping that takes into account the fact that the reads are paired-end. Otherwise, one can specify ``--parity=single``. If a predefined name is used in the ``-x`` technology string option, then kb-python uses the default parity option for that technology (e.g for ``-x Smartseq2``, the option ``--parity=paired`` is already enabled by default).

on list
^^^^^^^

Using the ``-w`` option:

For single-cell and single-nucleus sequencing assays, barcodes are used to identify each cell or nucleus. The **on list** of barcodes represents the known barcode sequences that are included in the assay. Barcodes extracted from the sequencing reads will be error-tolerantly mapped to this list in a process known as *barcode error correction*. The **on list** filename can be specified with the ``-w`` option in kb count (e.g. ``-w onlist_file.txt``. It can also be obtained by :ref:`seqspec<seqspec intro>`. If an **on list** is not provided or cannot be found for the given technology, then an **on list** is created by bustools via the :ref:`bustools allowlist<bustoolsbarcodes>` command which identifies repeating barcodes in sequencing reads. If the technology does not include cell barcodes (as is the case in bulk RNA-seq), the **on list** option is irrelevant and no barcode processing occurs which should be the case for assays that donâ€™t include cell/nuclei barcodes (skipping barcode error correction can also be done by specifying ``-w None``). If a predefined name is used in the ``-x`` technology string option, then kb-python uses the default **on list** option for that technology.
